## üéÆ Alpha-Beta Pruning AI

**This project implements an optimized AI using the advanced Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.**

Alpha-Beta Pruning is an improved version of the minimax algorithm used to find optimal moves in zero-sum games like chess and Othello, enhancing efficiency by eliminating unnecessary search paths.

```python
def alpha_beta_search(self, board, player, max_depth, alpha=-float('inf'), beta=float('inf')):
    # Termination condition: maximum depth reached or game over
    if max_depth == 0 or is_game_over(board):
        return eval_board(board, player), None

    # MAX player (Black)
    if player == BLACK:
        max_eval, best_move = -float('inf'), None
        for move in get_legal_moves(board, player):
            new_board = make_move(copy.deepcopy(board), move, player)
            eval = self.alpha_beta_search(new_board, WHITE, max_depth - 1, alpha, beta)[0]
            if eval > max_eval:
                max_eval, best_move = eval, move
            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # Pruning
        return max_eval, best_move
    # MIN player (White)
    else:
        min_eval, best_move = float('inf'), None
        for move in get_legal_moves(board, player):
            new_board = make_move(copy.deepcopy(board), move, player)
            eval = self.alpha_beta_search(new_board, BLACK, max_depth - 1, alpha, beta)[0]
            if eval < min_eval:
                min_eval, best_move = eval, move
            beta = min(beta, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # Pruning
        return min_eval, best_move
```

## üìã Project Overview

An Othello game application featuring a modern interface and AI opponents with various difficulty levels.

- **Game Modes**: User vs. User, User vs. AI
- **AI Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert (depths: 2, 4, 6, 8)
- **Hint System**: Feature that recommends optimal moves
- **User Statistics**: Records game results and win rates

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: Tkinter-based graphical interface
- **Current Player Display**: Shows whose turn it is (Black/White)
- **Move Highlighting**: Displays possible positions for the current player
- **Game Statistics Storage**: MySQL database integration
- **User Authentication**: Login and registration functionality
- **Surrender and Hint Features**: Options to give up or request assistance at any time

## üíª Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **GUI**: Tkinter
- **Database**: MySQL
- **AI Algorithm**: Alpha-Beta Pruning

## üîß Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install mysql-connector-python tkinter
   ```

3. MySQL Database Setup:
   - **Important**: You must download and install MySQL Workbench to manage the SQL file locally. The game will not run without setting up the database properly.
   - Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your local MySQL server
   - Run the SQL commands from `othello_revised.sql` to create the necessary database and tables
   - Configure the database connection in `database.py` with your MySQL credentials

4. Run the game:
   ```
   python GUI_Execute_to_Play.py
   ```

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **AI.py**: Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm implementation
- **backend.py**: Game logic and rule handling
- **constants.py**: Game constant definitions
- **database.py**: Database connection and statistics management
- **GUI_Execute_to_Play.py**: Graphical interface and main execution file
- **othello_revised.sql**: Database schema
